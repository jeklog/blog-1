<h5>My first attempt at making a folding tricopter using 3D printed parts</h5>

<p>A couple weeks ago I got myself my first personal 3D-printer (great mid-range printer, the CR-10 is extremely reliable for the price)
and one of the first few projects I decided to undertake using this new tool at my disposition</p>

<p>Many of the parts printed were designed by Michael Erwin (<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:486465">link to the files</a> 
with a few custom parts that I will likely post on thingiverse in just a bit.</p>

<p>The main reason I decided to go with a Tricopter build was to repurpose the parts I bought for building a quadcopter.<br>
First of all, a Tricopter is easier to design for folding, and I'm hoping to redesign the midframe to match my electronics better
once I get it flying (currently waiting on propellers, the current ones aren't giving me enough thrust and the motors have some leftover
power for larger propellers).<br>
The other reason is that when buying parts for my quadcopter back in 2014, I didn't think to buy motors with CCW threads, only CW, which means that
two of my motor nuts will tend to unscrew when spinning. This could be mitigated with a bit of locktite but that's not ideal. This issue
doesn't happen on tricopters because yaw control doesn't depend on having two pairs of counter-rotating motors varying power, but a
tricopter instead uses a servo on the tail rotor to vary the angle of the motor axis, which means all motors can rotate in the same direction
without losing yaw control.</p>

<h4>Printing the parts</h4>

<p>The CR-10 is a really amazing machine for the price. This must have been my 3rd print at that point if you don't count the ones where I tried printing directly
on the glass without any kind of adhesive, and these parts printed extremely well. This set of parts weighs about 100 grams if I remember correctly and took around
11 hours to print at 80mm/s speed setting in Cura</p>

<h4>Yaw actuation assembly</h4>

<p>Small servo for yaw with some piano wire attached to two screws. I didn't have any of those hex-lock contraptions which would have made it easier to tweak
but this seems to work ok. My only concern is the plastic gears on the servo which may break if I crash. I might need to upgrade it to a nicer servo.

<h4>Redrilling the holes</h4>

<p>Hole features tend to be underdimensionned on FDM printers. You can either take that into account in software or simply accept that the
holes will be too small and re-drill the holes once the part is done printing which is a reliable method of getting perfectly sized holes</p>
