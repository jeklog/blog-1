<p>Flew over Greenland yesterday, and managed to get this wonderful picture. Reminds me of how much I miss the Iceland.</p>

<img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4296/35249131154_3f2bdd7d57_o.jpg" style="width:100%">

<p>The picture makes it look like we're lower than we are, and the window left a few smudges but oh well. Reminds me of how great summers in the arctic are though, so I thought I'd add a few pictures of my summer in Iceland 2 years ago.</p>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-footer="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/135573610@N03/albums/72157657286144079" title="Iceland"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5659/20824883806_2d543178fe_o.jpg" style="width:100%" alt="Iceland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Some of these pictures could use a bit less editing, I was a bit heavy-handed on the saturation (I still have the originals and might attempt to fix them up at some point, I tend to over-edit), but some of them really capture how beautiful Iceland can be.</p>

<p>Note: This is an old post from my old blog on my self-hosted server. Because of uptime issues I had to migrate it and didn't get to use it as much as I wanted.</p>
